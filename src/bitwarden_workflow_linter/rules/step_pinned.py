    For any external Action (any Action that does not fit the above definition of
    an Internal Action), to mitigate the risks of supply chain attacks in our CI

    and pre-approved after a security audit of the version of the Action.

        Pinning external Action hashes prevents unknown updates that could
        break the pipelines or be the entry point to a supply chain attack.

        Pinning internal Actions to branches allow for less updates as work
        is done on those repos. This is mainly to support our Action
        monorepo architecture of our Actions.

        Example:
        - name: Checkout Branch
          uses: actions/checkout@b4ffde65f46336ab88eb53be808477a3936bae11 # v4.1.1

        - name: Test Local Action
          uses: ./actions/test-action

        - name: Test Run Action
          run: echo "test"

        In this example, 'actions/checkout' must be pinned to the full commit
        of the tag while 'bitwarden/gh-actions/get-keyvault-secrets' must be
        pinned to 'main'. The other two Steps will be skipped.
