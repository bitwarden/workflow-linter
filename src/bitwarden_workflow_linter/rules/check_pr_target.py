        To ensure pull_request_target is safe to use, the check-run step is added
        to all jobs as a dependency.

        Once a branch is pushed to Github, it already opens up a vulnerability
        even if the check-run scan fails to detect this.

        In order to prevent a vulnerable branch from being used for an attack
        prior to being caught through vetting, all pull_request_target workflows
        should only be run by users with appropriate permissions.

        This greatly reduces the risk as community contributors can't use a fork to run a compromised workflow that uses pull_request_target.
