    Automated testing is not easily written for GitHub Action Workflows. CI can also
    get complicated really quickly and take up hundreds of lines. All of this can
    make it very difficult to debug and troubleshoot, especially when environment
    variables can be set in four different places: Workflow level, Job level, Step
    level, and inside a shell Step.

    To alleviate some of the pain, we have decided that all Job level environment
    variables should be prefixed with an underscore. All Workflow environment
    variables are normally at the top of the file and Step level ones are pretty
    visible when debugging a shell Step.
