        # - Changing directories will help catch any repo specific paths in the linter
        #   that would not work in a different repository
        # - Changing directories utilizes the default_settings.yaml rather than this repos
        #   settings.yaml, which better simulates running from another repository
        # - Using strict to ensure that our examples pass all checks including warnings
